This is a simple Java function which will return a new valid BSN Number.

<h2>Note:</h2> This function does not care about the uniqueness of the BSNs generated. It is possible that same BSN number gets generated multiple times.
If you want to make sure that every time this function returns a unique BSN, then refer the other function which i have created to generate unique BSN Number.
